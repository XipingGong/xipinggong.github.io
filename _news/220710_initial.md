This new baby is designed to record my growth, and will
be continuously updated!
This is created based on a [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and
hosted on the [GitHub pages](https://github.com/xipinggong/xipinggong.github.io) now.
We also used the [Google domains](https://domains.google/) to create our domain and manage it.
I really appreciate the significant contributions from
[Erik](https://eriknordquist.com/) and
[Jian](https://huang-jian.com/) who helped me
how to change the domain, initialize, update website, and more.
