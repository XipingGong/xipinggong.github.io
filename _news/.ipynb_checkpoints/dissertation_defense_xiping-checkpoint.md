I (Xiping) am thrilled to share that I have successfully defended my Ph.D. dissertation titled "Atomistic Simulations of Intrinsically Disordered Protein Folding and Dynamics." This milestone marks the culmination of my hard work and dedication to advancing research in this field. My work utilized the GBMV2 implicit solvent models to explore the folding and dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins.
Congratulations to myself on this achievementâ€”I am incredibly proud of this accomplishment! I really thank all people who helped me
and gave me the support, especially for my advisor [Dr. Jianhan Chen](https://people.chem.umass.edu/jchenlab/main.html).
